"""Guard: this repo must be self-contained.

It must not carry references to the shared origin repo, to the parallel
shell-based variant, or to the origin's obsolete installer mechanism — those
couplings are exactly what moving to a standalone project removed. This test
scans every **git-tracked** text file and fails if a forbidden token appears
anywhere (e.g. a doc still pointing at the origin's old per-tool installer
instead of this plugin's namespaced /sdd:* commands).

Only tracked files are checked because they are what ships in the published
plugin. Gitignored scratch (e.g. local review notes under docs/reviews/, or a
machine-local settings.local.json) may legitimately name the origin and is not
part of the distribution. Outside a git checkout, the test falls back to walking
the tree.

The forbidden tokens are assembled from fragments on purpose, so this guard file
does not itself contain the literal strings it searches for — which means it can
scan its own tree without a self-exclusion and the result is a true "zero
occurrences anywhere" check.
