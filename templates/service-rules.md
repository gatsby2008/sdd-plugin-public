# Service Rules — <service-name>

> **Ownership:** <which module/service/class owns this; who enforces it. Note cross-boundary
> identity fields — the ones owned by external systems that must never be generated or mutated
> locally.>

## Key concepts

<The minimum domain model an agent needs to reason correctly: the entities, their states, the
source of truth. A small state table is often clearer than prose.>

| Entity | Key identity fields | Source of truth |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| `<Entity>` | `<field>` (<description>) | <who owns it; never re-generated locally> |

## Business Invariants

- External clients (Feign, SOAP, REST adapters) must never be called directly from services — always through a dedicated processor or adapter layer that returns `Optional<T>` and swallows all exceptions.
- Soft-deleted entities (`isDeleted = true`) must never be returned to callers. Filter in repository custom queries or mapper methods — never in controllers or services.
- JPA entities must never be returned directly from controllers. Always map through MapStruct to a response DTO before returning.
- _(Add service-specific invariants here — ownership rules, atomicity contracts, circuit-breaker conditions, event semantics, etc.)_

> **Implementation note (verified <date>):** _(Add when a past bug or workaround shapes an
> invariant — name the class or flow and what breaks if the rule is violated.)_

## Fallback and Idempotency

- External calls are the only side-effects in any given operation; all other logic must be read-only where possible.
- When propagating a change to multiple external systems, wrap each call in its own `try-catch`, log on failure, never rethrow (fire-and-forget sync).
- _(Add idempotency keys, duplicate-processing guards, and rollback boundaries specific to this service.)_

## Architecture Constraints

- Constructor injection only — no `@Autowired`, no field injection, no setter injection. Use `@RequiredArgsConstructor` (Lombok) or an explicit constructor.
- External integrations must go through dedicated processor/adapter layers. No direct HTTP/SOAP/SDK calls from service classes.
- _(Add stack-specific constraints: identity field mappings, TLS versions, auth flows, circuit-breaker state ownership, etc.)_

## Historical Constraints

- Existing public API endpoint contracts must remain unchanged unless a versioned migration is introduced.
- _(Add backward-compatibility rules specific to this service — event schemas, consumer expectations, identity paths that must not be changed.)_

> **Implementation note (verified <date>):** _(Explain why a historical constraint exists and
> what breaks if it is violated. Name the class or flow to watch.)_

## Out of Scope (Do Not Add Here)

- Ticket-only decisions
- Temporary rollout notes
- Dates, branch names, or one-off implementation tasks
