# Service Catalog

Scans the current service, generates a single-page catalog entry documenting what the
service does, what it exposes, what it publishes, what it consumes, and who it calls,
and **stores it directly in the central service-catalog registry** (no copy is left in
the service repo). Supports Java Spring Boot and frontend (React / Next.js / Vue).

Generated from the code, not written by hand. Accurate by default.

## Usage

```bash
# Scan the codebase, generate the catalog, and store it in the registry
/sdd:doc-catalog

# Show the catalogs already in the registry
/sdd:doc-catalog list
```

The catalog is written to `service-catalog/<service-name>.md` under
`~/.claude/` (or `$CLAUDE_DOC_HOME` for a team-shared registry). On completion the
command prints the stored path. Query the registry with `/sdd:doc-catalog-query`.

# Service: creditbureau-service

## Overview
Queries DataVendor for credit and vehicle data on behalf of leads-service...

## Endpoints
| Method | Path | Description | Auth |
|--------|------|-------------|------|
| POST | /api/v1/datavendor/search-person | ... | Cognito JWT |
| GET | /internal/datavendor/circuit/status | ... | Cognito JWT |

## Publishes (SNS)
| Topic | Event type | Trigger |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `credit-results-topic` | `CreditReportReady` | DataVendor returns a result |

## Consumes (SQS)
| Queue | Source topic | Event type | Published by |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|

## Calls (Feign)
| Service | Base URL property | Auth | Resilience | Purpose |
|---------|------------------|------|-----------|---------|
| leads-service | `${feign.leads-service.url}` | Bearer (`ServiceUserPoolCredentials`) | 3× retry, 20s/60s | Fetch lead data |

## Webhooks & Callbacks
| Direction | Method | Path / Property | Auth | Payload |

## Why this matters

In a microservices architecture, knowing who publishes and who consumes a given
SNS event is critical for debugging and impact analysis. Without a catalog, the
answer requires searching across every repo.

With every service's catalog in one central registry, you can:
- Answer "who consumes `CreditCheckRequested`?" with `/sdd:doc-catalog-query`
- See the full dependency chain of a service at a glance
- Onboard new developers without a live walkthrough

## Independent of the SDD pipeline

This skill has no dependency on `.specwork/` artifacts. It can be run on any
existing Spring Boot service at any time.
